Line-by-line explanation

import numpy as np
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

import numpy as np — imports the NumPy library and gives it the short name np. NumPy provides fast arrays and numeric operations.

from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB — imports the MultinomialNB class from scikit-learn (the machine-learning library). You need scikit-learn installed (pip install scikit-learn) to use this.


# -------------------------
# Simple encoding for categories
# -------------------------
age = {'SuperSeniorCitizen': 0, 'SeniorCitizen': 1, 'MiddleAged': 2, 'Youth': 3, 'Teen': 4}
gender = {'Male': 0, 'Female': 1}
family_history = {'Yes': 0, 'No': 1}
diet = {'High': 0, 'Medium': 1, 'Low': 2}
lifestyle = {'Athlete': 0, 'Active': 1, 'Moderate': 2, 'Sedentary': 3}
cholesterol = {'High': 0, 'BorderLine': 1, 'Normal': 2}

These lines create Python dictionaries that map text categories to integer codes. Machine-learning models require numeric input; the dictionaries let you print the mapping for the user so they can type the correct number.

Example: 'Male' → 0, 'Female' → 1.


> Note: Using simple integer codes like this is called ordinal encoding. For purely categorical values with no natural order, one-hot encoding is usually safer. MultinomialNB expects counts/integers ≥ 0, so ordinal encoding can work but be careful about implying an order that doesn't exist.



# -------------------------
# Sample medical dataset
# Each row: [age, gender, familyHistory, diet, lifestyle, cholesterol]
# Label: 0 = Heart Disease (Yes), 1 = No Heart Disease
# -------------------------
X = np.array([
    [0,1,0,1,3,0], [1,0,0,0,2,0], [2,0,0,0,3,0],
    [1,1,0,1,2,0], [2,1,0,0,2,0], [3,0,1,2,1,1],
    [4,1,1,2,2,2], [4,1,1,2,3,2], [3,1,1,2,3,1], [2,0,1,2,2,1]
])
y = np.array([0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1])

X is a NumPy 2D array with shape (10, 6) — 10 examples, each with 6 features.

Each sublist is one patient record: [age_code, gender_code, familyHistory_code, diet_code, lifestyle_code, cholesterol_code].


y is a 1D NumPy array of labels with shape (10,).

Here 0 means Heart Disease = Yes and 1 means No Heart Disease (unusual ordering — pay attention to this).


np.array(...) converts Python lists into NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays are efficient and the format scikit-learn expects.


# -------------------------
# Train Naive Bayes model
# -------------------------
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X, y)

model = MultinomialNB() — creates a Naive Bayes classifier for multinomial (count) data. Default parameter alpha=1.0 applies Laplace smoothing (prevents zero probabilities).

model.fit(X, y) — trains (fits) the model to the data. The model learns:

class_prior_ — P(class) for each class.

conditional probabilities P(feature_value | class) (in the multinomial case this is based on counts).


After fit, the model is ready to predict on new data.


# -------------------------
# User input and prediction
# -------------------------
print("Enter patient medical data as numbers corresponding to the categories:")

try:
    a = int(input(f"Age {age}: "))
    g = int(input(f"Gender {gender}: "))
    f = int(input(f"Family History {family_history}: "))
    d = int(input(f"Diet {diet}: "))
    l = int(input(f"Lifestyle {lifestyle}: "))
    c = int(input(f"Cholesterol {cholesterol}: "))

print(...) — prints a message to the console.

input(prompt) — shows a prompt and waits for the user to type a string and press Enter. It always returns a string.

int(...) — converts that string to an integer. If the user types something that can't be converted to int, Python will raise a ValueError.

The f"..." strings are f-strings (formatted string literals). When you write f"Age {age}: " the current value of age dictionary is converted to text and inserted into the prompt. This helps the user see the mapping like {'SuperSeniorCitizen': 0, ...}.


patient = np.array([[a, g, f, d, l, c]])
    prob = model.predict_proba(patient)[0]
    prediction = "Yes" if prob[0] > prob[1] else "No"

patient = np.array([[...]]) — creates a 2D NumPy array with one row and 6 columns. Scikit-learn methods expect 2D arrays of shape (n_samples, n_features). If you did np.array([a, g, f, d, l, c]) it would be 1D and the model would complain.

model.predict_proba(patient) — returns a 2D array with class probabilities for each sample. For one sample, it returns something like [[0.7, 0.3]]. The shape is (1, n_classes).

[0] picks the first row (the only patient), giving a 1D array like [0.7, 0.3].

prob[0] is the probability of the class model.classes_[0]. In your code model.classes_ is likely array([0,1]), so prob[0] is P(class=0) (Heart Disease), prob[1] is P(class=1) (No).

prediction = "Yes" if prob[0] > prob[1] else "No" — a ternary conditional expression. If probability of class 0 (heart disease) is greater than class 1, set prediction to "Yes", otherwise "No".


print("\n=== Heart Disease Diagnosis ===")
    print(f"Probability of Heart Disease: {prob[0]:.2f}")
    print(f"Probability of No Heart Disease: {prob[1]:.2f}")
    print(f"Final Prediction: {prediction}")

\n adds a newline for cleaner output.

f"{prob[0]:.2f}" — formats the probability to 2 decimal places (e.g., 0.72).

These lines print the probabilities and the final string prediction.


except Exception as e:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers.", e)

try/except is an error-handling block. If anything inside try fails (e.g., int() conversion fails, or model.predict_proba raises an error), Python jumps to except.

except Exception as e: captures the exception object in variable e. print(..., e) prints a message plus the exception details for debugging.

Key concepts explained simply

NumPy arrays vs Python lists

Python list: general purpose. Example: [1, 2, 3].

NumPy array: fixed-type, fast, supports vectorized math. Example: np.array([1,2,3]).

Scikit-learn expects NumPy arrays (or similar) shaped as (n_samples, n_features).


Shape

X.shape returns a tuple like (10, 6) (10 rows, 6 columns).

For a single sample you still pass a 2D array [[...]] so shape would be (1, 6).


Multinomial Naive Bayes

A probabilistic classifier that works well for discrete counts (word counts in text classification are the classic use case).

It assumes features are counts and are conditionally independent given the class.

It uses Bayes theorem: P(class | features) ∝ P(class) * Π P(feature_i | class).

Smoothing (alpha) prevents zero probabilities when a certain feature value was not seen in training for a class.


predict_proba vs predict

predict_proba(X) returns probabilities for each class.

predict(X) returns the most likely class label (no probabilities).

In your code you computed probabilities then used them to choose the final label — same as model.predict(patient) but with extra info shown to the user.

Common problems & debugging tips

ValueError from int(): user typed non-numeric text. Either validate the input or use input() then check .isdigit() or try converting and catch ValueError.

Wrong shapes: ValueError: Expected 2D array, got 1D array instead — fix by wrapping data in double brackets [[...]].

Small dataset / overfitting: with only 10 rows the model will not generalize. Always split data into train/test and evaluate (e.g., train_test_split, cross_val_score).

Feature encoding: simple integer encoding can accidentally introduce order. For purely nominal categories, use one-hot encoding (e.g., OneHotEncoder) or pd.get_dummies.

MultinomialNB assumptions: features should be non-negative counts or frequencies. For continuous numeric features consider GaussianNB instead.



---

Small improvements you can make

Use model.predict(patient)[0] instead of manual comparison: it's clearer and uses the model's internal logic.

Explicit mapping of label→text: avoid relying on class order. Example:

probs = model.predict_proba(patient)[0]
predicted_class = model.classes_[probs.argmax()]
print("Predicted class:", predicted_class)

Then map 0/1 to text ("Heart Disease"/"No Heart Disease") using a dictionary.

Validate inputs: check they are within the allowed range (e.g., age codes 0–4).

Replace ordinal encoding with one-hot if categories are nominal.

Split your data and compute accuracy:

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Test accuracy:", model.score(X_test, y_test))

Quick glossary

f-string: f"Hello {name}" — inserts name’s value into the string.

try/except: handles exceptions so your program doesn’t crash.

np.array: creates a NumPy array.

model.fit(X, y): trains the model on features X and labels y.

model.predict_proba(X): returns probabilities for each class.

Alpha (smoothing): a parameter for Naive Bayes that avoids zero probs.

If you want, I can:

Rewrite the script to do proper input validation and clearer label mapping.

Convert the categorical fields to one-hot encoding and show how to train safely.

Add a train/test split and print model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).


Which of those would help you next?

Absolutely! Let’s go step by step and explain this code in simple terms for a beginner, including the purpose of each syntax.


---

1️⃣ Import Libraries

import pandas as pd  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer  
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB  
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score

pandas (pd): Library used for handling data in tables (like Excel). Here we use it to create a dataset.

train_test_split: Splits data into training and testing sets.

CountVectorizer: Converts text into numbers (matrix of word counts) because machine learning algorithms cannot understand text directly.

MultinomialNB: Naive Bayes classifier, a simple algorithm commonly used for spam detection.

accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score: Functions to check how well the model is performing.



---

2️⃣ Load Data

data = [  
    ['ham', "Hey, are we still on for dinner tonight?"],  
    ['spam', "WINNER! You have won a free cruise. Call now!"],  
    ...
]  

df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["label", "text"])  
df['label'] = df['label'].map({'ham': 0, 'spam': 1})

data: A small example dataset with two columns: label (spam or ham) and text (the message).

pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[...]): Converts the list of lists into a table (DataFrame) with column names label and text.

df['label'].map({'ham': 0, 'spam': 1}): Converts text labels into numbers (0 for ham, 1 for spam) because ML algorithms work with numbers.


✅ Example output of df:

label	text

0	Hey, are we still on for dinner tonight?
1	WINNER! You have won a free cruise. Call now!
…	…



---

3️⃣ Split Data into Training and Test Sets

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(  
    df['text'], df['label'], test_size=0.3, random_state=42  
)

train_test_split: Divides data into:

Training set (X_train, y_train): Used to train the model.

Test set (X_test, y_test): Used to check if the model works on unseen data.


test_size=0.3: 30% of the data is used for testing, 70% for training.

random_state=42: Fixes the randomness so results are reproducible.



---

4️⃣ Convert Text to Numbers

vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')  
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)  
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

CountVectorizer: Converts text into a matrix of numbers where each column represents a word and each row represents a message.

stop_words='english': Ignores common words like "the", "is", "and" to focus on meaningful words.

fit_transform: Learns the vocabulary from training data and converts it into numbers.

transform: Converts test data into numbers using the same vocabulary (without learning new words).


✅ Example:
"Hey, are we still on for dinner tonight?" → [0,0,1,0,...] (numbers represent word counts).


---

5️⃣ Train the Naive Bayes Model

model = MultinomialNB()  
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)

MultinomialNB(): Creates a Naive Bayes classifier for text data.

fit(X_train_vec, y_train): Teaches the model using training data. It learns which words are common in spam vs ham.



---

6️⃣ Evaluate the Model

y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vec)  

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)  
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)  
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)

predict: Model predicts labels (spam/ham) for the test data.

accuracy_score: Percentage of correct predictions.

precision_score: Out of all messages predicted as spam, how many were actually spam.

recall_score: Out of all actual spam messages, how many were correctly predicted.


print("=== Evaluation ===")  
print(f"Accuracy:  {accuracy:.2f}")  
print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}")  
print(f"Recall:    {recall:.2f}")

Prints model performance in a readable format.



---

7️⃣ Predict New Messages

test_messages = [  
    "Your loan is approved! Call now to claim.",  
    "Hi, just checking in to see how you're doing.",  
    ...
]  

test_vec = vectorizer.transform(test_messages)  
predictions = model.predict(test_vec)

New messages are converted to numbers using the same vectorizer.

Model predicts spam (1) or ham (0).


for msg, pred in zip(test_messages, predictions):  
    print(f"'{msg}' => {'spam' if pred==1 else 'ham'}")

Loops through messages and predictions.

Prints a readable output:


'Your loan is approved! Call now to claim.' => spam
'Hi, just checking in to see how you're doing.' => ham


---

✅ Summary of the Process

1. Load data → Convert labels to numbers.


2. Split data into training and test sets.


3. Convert text to numbers using CountVectorizer.


4. Train a Naive Bayes model.


5. Evaluate model performance with accuracy, precision, recall.


6. Use the model to predict new messages as spam or ham.

If you want, I can also draw a simple diagram showing how text moves from words → numbers → predictions, which makes it super easy for beginners to visualize.

📘 Naive Bayes Spam Classifier — Doubts & Answers


---

1️⃣ What are X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test?

They come from train_test_split.


X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    df['text'], df['label'], test_size=0.3, random_state=42
)

X_train → Training messages (input text).

y_train → Training labels (0 = ham, 1 = spam).

X_test → Testing messages (input text, unseen by model).

y_test → Testing labels (answers for test data).


✅ Example after splitting:

X_train: “Hey, are we still on for dinner tonight?”, “Lunch tomorrow?”, …

y_train: [0, 0, …]

X_test: “WINNER! You have won a free cruise. Call now!”, …

y_test: [1, …]



---

2️⃣ What does this mean?

vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

CountVectorizer → Converts text into numbers (bag of words model).

stop_words='english' → Removes common useless words like "is", "the".

fit_transform(X_train) →

fit = learns all unique words (vocabulary).

transform = converts training text into word count vectors.


transform(X_test) → Converts test text using same vocabulary (no new learning).


✅ Example:
Vocabulary → [account, call, free, win]
Message “Win free call” → [0,1,1,1]


---

3️⃣ Why do we use fit again here?

model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)

This time, the object is Naive Bayes classifier, not the vectorizer.

fit means learn:

Learns word probabilities for spam vs ham.

Example: word “win” appears 90% in spam → strong spam indicator.



👉 Two different learners:

1. vectorizer.fit → learns vocabulary (words → numbers).


2. model.fit → learns classification (numbers → spam/ham).




---

4️⃣ What is :.2f in f-strings?

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

:.2f means format as float with 2 decimal places.

Example:

3.14159 → 3.14

0.85714 → 0.86



✅ Used to make results cleaner (instead of long decimals).


---

5️⃣ What does this syntax mean?

for msg, pred in zip(test_messages, predictions):
    print(f"'{msg}' => {'spam' if pred==1 else 'ham'}")

zip(test_messages, predictions) → pairs each message with its prediction.

f-string inserts message and prediction into a string.

'spam' if pred==1 else 'ham' → short inline if-else:

If prediction = 1 → spam.

If prediction = 0 → ham.



✅ Example Output:

'Your loan is approved! Call now to claim.' => spam
'Hi, just checking in to see how you're doing.' => ham


---

🎯 Quick Flow of the Whole Code

1. Dataset → messages + labels (ham/spam).


2. Split → training set (to learn), test set (to evaluate).


3. Vectorize → convert text → numbers.


4. Train → Naive Bayes model learns spam vs ham.


5. Evaluate → print accuracy, precision, recall.


6. Predict new messages → print whether spam/ham.
